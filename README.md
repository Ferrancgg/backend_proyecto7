Sorry for my english but I'm working to improve it .
This is my firts backend proyect. 
I create a Data Bases by model car . 
You can use this routes to CRUD .
I hope that you will enjoy investigate this.

Thanks for your time.

CRUD:
create a car:
    http://localhost:4001/api/v1/cars
get all cars:
    http://localhost:4001/api/v1/cars
get car by id:
    http://localhost:4001/api/v1/cars/:id
update car:
  http://localhost:4001/api/v1/cars/:id
delete car by id:
  http://localhost:4001/api/v1/cars/:id
